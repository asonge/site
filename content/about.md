I\'m currently 24 years old, and just starting my 3rd year as a PhD student.

During my undergraduate career at the University of Minnesota - Morris, I focused my work primarily on OpenAFS and distributed systems, completing 2 years of Google Summer of Code (2008 and 2009), as well as a summer REU at Carnegie Mellon working on Internet Suspend and Resume.

After these experiences, my interests broadened to technology that has a more direct impact societally.

My research interests encompass mobile computing, and the role that mobile devices can play in affecting social change. I currently work on CitizenSense, a smartphone and web platform for crowdsourcing real-world data gathering, for use by non-profits, advocacy groups, and local municipalities.
