Hi, welcome.

In case you couldn\'t tell by the URL, I\'m Jake.

Here you\'ll find my academic work, and various other ephemera.

__I\...__

* __Think__ about the role technology can play in social change, to empower
individuals and groups of people both individually and organizationally. 

* __Study__ at the University of Minnesota, and I work in the GroupLens
HCI lab, with Dr. Loren Terveen. My particular interests lie in the ways that
technology can support and augment social goals and processes.

* __Build__ a system called CitizenSense, for crowdsourcing data in the world
around us.

* __Photograph__ the minutae in the world. I try to capture the things that are
in the world, but not at the forefront of what people are attentive to. I really
enjoy both the technical and the (I believe) artistic aspects of the medium.
